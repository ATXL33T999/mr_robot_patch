# Christian Slater's Mr. Robot patch

## The screencap

The patch recreation started from this screencap:

![Screencap](artwork/patch-capture.png?raw=true "Patch screencap")

## The desgin

![Design](artwork/patch-design.png?raw=true "Patch design")

The MR. ROBOT patch text and show logo is essentially the
[NiseSega font](http://www.thealmightyguru.com/GameFonts/Series-Sega.html)
created by fan HariHariSonic with a modified 'B'. For the patch, the center
line is thickened and colored in.

The "Computer Repair with a Smile" font appears to be the 
[Giuluio Bold](http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontsite/giulio) font which can
be purchased quite reasonably.

The robot image in the center was created by creating a grid over the screen
capture of the patch and tracing over the robot in blocks.

## Actual Patch

The thread color choices were from the lsacord color chart as follows:

* Dark Grey/Border = (Charcoal - 0111)
* Red = Darker Red (Special Red - 1902)
* Light Grey (Sterling - 0124)
* Yellow = (Yellow - 0600)

## Christian Slater's jacket

I believe that the jacket worn by Christian Slater was a uniform jacket
produced by Eastern Uniform, which does not appear to still be produced. It
appears to be very similar in form to the Cintas Ike Jacket - 971 which is not
available in brown or with a red lining.
